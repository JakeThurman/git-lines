# git-lines
Bash script to print the lines contributed to a repository by each user.

To use the script, copy the [git-lines](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeThurman/git-lines/master/git-lines) file into the desired directory and run the command **git-lines** from the command line. 

You can also specify a commit range to search by providing it as an argument: **git-lines origin/2.0_release..origin/3.0_release**.
